            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, I'm Pineapples, a web/game developer. I enjoy making fun games for a hobby!
                I live in the United States and I started programming in 2018, when I was 8.
                In Febuary, 2022 I created a Khan Academy account and started their introduction to programming course.
                Since then, I've made many projects on there, most significantly games.
                Now I plan to make more cool stuff before I go off to college, hopefully for a CS or Software
                Engineering
                Degree.
                Some of my other hobbies include skiing, hiking, biking, and photography.
                All the background images on this website are taken by me.
                I am a member of the boy scouts and currently have obtained the Life rank.
            </p>
